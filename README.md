# Learn How To Use Firebase

This project is a website where people can share their experiences (by posting text only, no photos). People here can also interact in the comments section. I made this project to practice and understand how Firebase works and how to use its features.

in this project i learned :
- Create authentication using Email and Google account
- Use Firebase as a NoSQL database (Cloud Firestore)
- How to create, update, and delete data in Firebase using Collections and Documents
